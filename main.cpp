//  This program simulates bone marrow HSC behavior and
//  also does a very simplified simulation of blood production
//  from HSCs. This simulation expands blood cells
//  of various types (gran/mono/nk etc), with a bit of time delay, into a
//  collections (very) roughly cooresponding to a blood cell population that
//  we can then simulate performing Insertion Site Analysis (ISA) processing on.
//
//  This simulation is only meant to show how time delay expansion of progenitor
//  cells can be sampled with ISA. There is no claim that any of these expansion
//  pathways are actually realistic. We don't have that information in enough detail
//  yet that it would be worthwhile to simulate
//
//  To run this program, make an entry in the TEST_PARAM array

//	int cells;      starting cells

//	120000  - starting stem cells
//	0.8     - HSC replication rate at start (is really inverse...20% cycle per 'day')
//	0.8     - HSC replication rate for long term...since both 0.8, 20% cycle...not change
//	20      - day cell cycle would change
//	0.52    - chance stay stem when hsc division occurs
//	1.0     - mean for epigenetic cycle time differences
//	0.05    - var for epigenetic cycle differnce
//	s       - store results
