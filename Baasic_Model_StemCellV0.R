#
#  very simple simulation for stem cells in NHP translpant
#
#  from RNAseq data:
#   snap-shot stem cell cell division rate ~= 0.15
#   all stem cells are equivalent
#   many stem cell (ISA cell ID) are lost early
#   stem cells (ISA cell ID) become stabily identified late
#    
#   to simulate will assume 1 day = amount of time for stem cell to complete cell cycle
#   all cells equally likely to cycle
#   when a cell cycles, each daughter makes a decision to stay stem or differentiate
#   odds are 50-50  for a stable stem cell population
#
#
# running this script shows stem cell diversity drops from 10,000 to about 700 
# with some small run-to-run variation 
#
# the script shows large clones of about 100 members and lower form
#
# the script shows many clones fully differentiate early and are then lost
#   
#
